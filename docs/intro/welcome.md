Welcome to the TELUS Design System component library. The design system is based on the principles, characteristics, and
aesthetics of the TELUS brand. We embed the brand into React components which are available in this component library. 

To learn more about the design system and design principles, or how to get started, please visit the [TDS Github repository](https://github.com/TelusDigital/tds).

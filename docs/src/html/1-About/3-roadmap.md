To help you prioritize what you are working on and to share insight into our priorities, we've published TDS Roadmap. This roadmap is a rough estimate of what we're focused on building in the near-, medium-, and long-term. Please check in regularly to find out about recent and upcoming milestones.

The items in the roadmap are subject to change or delay, so you shouldn't use this for major planning purposes. We'll do our best to keep the roadmap updated as things change. We'll revise the roadmap monthly to ensure it reflects our most up-to-date thinking.

## Objective
The goal is for TDS to be a platform designed to enable autonomous digital teams to share and contribute to a constantly evolving global design and code library.


## Current Roadmap
- [Near-term](#near-term)
- [Medium-term](#mid-term)
- [Long-term](#long-term)


## Near-term
Getting the foundations right and then invite more users into the system, to enhance the design system using the contribution model.

## Mid-term
Open rollout and usage of TDS system and design guild usage and contribution model to all of TELUS.

- **TDS Website**: Enhanced TDS site experience (information architecture update, access to previous design and code versions)

- **GTM**: Roll out internal / external marketing campaigns.


## Long-term
Shift focus from building to maintaining the system. Scale user base to include more internal / external users. Define and integrate experience packages into system.

- **Experience Packages**: The design system is tied together with content and a recommendation is provided around its usage. It will connect business drivers and the TDS to unify the navigation experience of TELUS digital.

- **TDS Intro and Education video**

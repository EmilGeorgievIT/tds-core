# Contributing to TDS

Thank you for deciding to make a contribution! There are several ways you can contribute to TDS.

Contributions to design, code, accessibility, usability, documentation, etc are all welcome! If you have any questions, see [support](SUPPORT.md).

**Note**: the TDS 'Core' React library undergoes a rigorous review process as we address several important characteristics that make up a 'core' React component, which includes but is not limited to:

* Is the component highly reusable?
* Is the component accessible?
* Does the component satisfy an immediate and ongoing outcome for multiple teams?
* Does the component comply with TELUS branding guidelines? <!-- TODO add link -->

We would appreciate your patience during this process. Once a cataloguing system has been released, there will be opportunities to self-govern your own components; learn more by reading our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

When in doubt, feel free to [reach out to us](SUPPORT.md).

## Contribution process (TDS Core)

### 1. Submit an issue {#1-submit-issue}

If you found a bug, fixed a bug, have a suggestion, or would like to begin a conversation, the first step is to open a new issue. If you would like to make a small adjustment to documentation, you may jump to [opening a pull request][PR].

* Ensure the issue was not already reported by searching the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues)
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues/new)
* Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and - if applicable - a code sample or executable test case demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring

Learn [how to open an issue on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

### 2. Develop solution

Once an issue has been delegated to you, or if you are making an adjustment to documentation, you may develop your solution.

* Before submitting a pull request, please refer to the [Standards guide](STANDARDS.md) to comply with all our standards <!-- TODO: make this a CI linting thing as well -->

After completion, you may open a pull request.

### 3. Pull request {#3-pull-request}
<!-- 
  TODO: do we want people to go straight to PR, or to open an issue first? 
  Current assumption: issue/discussion first
-->

First, thanks! :) 

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable
* Sit back and wait for the core team to get back to you

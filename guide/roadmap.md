# TDS Roadmap

We value transparency with our developments and decisions. Here you will find a glimpse of what is to come.

## Current: Platform Release 1 (January 2018)

- Complete items to be included in the "Release 1" candidate of the TELUS Design System
  - Craft Library for Sketch symbols containing all TDS symbols, blocks, and layouts
  - 'Core' TDS React component package release v1.0.0 that includes more form components, and **no global CSS** class-based elements

## Next: Platform Release 2 (Q2 2018)

<!-- TODO: include diagram of before and after -->
- Create and maintain a 'component catalogue' system for easy sharability of React components
  - Include a federated 'Core' suite of components (currently distributed as [@telusdigital/tds](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@telusdigital/tds) on npm), and a 'Labs' catalogue of TELUS developer components with relaxed governance
  - Improved contribution process for 'core' components

## Future

<!-- TODO: add a link here to GitHub discussions, or create a discussion anchor in the sidebar, or add to 'support' document -->
- Component bundling and caching across all TELUS web properties
- Adopting a CSS-in-JS methodology
- You decide! [Learn how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md#discuss) and discuss features

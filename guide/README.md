# TELUS Design System

The TELUS Design System (TDS) is a set of living guidelines that communicates our brand promise through our digital experiences.
It's a holistic platform that integrates documentation, guidelines and design management and that serves as single source for
digital design guidelines, code patterns and UI elements.

TDS is intended for use by TELUS employees and approved vendors.

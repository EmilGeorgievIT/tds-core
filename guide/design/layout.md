# Layout

## Overview

Well designed page layouts are created through the consistent application of alignment and white space. The TELUS Design 
System uses a 12 column grid and a spacing system to assist you in creating a visual rhythm across experiences.

## Usage

See the following components for implementation details:

* [Grid](ref:///components/index.html#grid)
* [FlexGrid](ref:///components/index.html#flexgrid)
* [Responsive](ref:///components/index.html#responsive)
* [Box](ref:///components/index.html#box)


## Governance

The layout system is managed by the Design Strategy team and we are open to improvements and contributions. If you would 
have any ideas, suggestions or questions regarding implementation please [get in touch with us](/support.md).


## Roadmap

* More documentation on the overall layout system

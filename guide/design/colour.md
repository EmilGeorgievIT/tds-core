# Colour

## Overview

Colour creates visual impact and distinguishes a brand. It conveys personality, attracts the eye and indicates change. 

Our main brand colours are white, purple and green. White is the most dominant colour in our palette and should be the 
foundation of every page. Purple and green are used to accent white space through buttons, text colour, and links.

All colours used to convey non-redundant information must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

The following colours are specific to digital experiences. For the full guidelines on using colour, including traditional 
media and other forms of communications, visit [BrandHub](https://brand.telus.com).


## Usage

For Buttons, Links, Headings and Body copy only use the following colours:

## Exceptions

These colours are not part of the TELUS brand colour palette, however are used sparingly, but intentionally to play a 
functional role and support a positive user experience. Example uses include notifications, errors and messaging.

## Governance

The TELUS digital colour palette is mandated by the TELUS Brand team and should not be adjusted without explicit approval. If 
you should have any questions regarding implementation, please [get in touch with us](/support.md).

## Roadmap

* v1.0: Basic colour palette implemented as Sass variables
* Expose colour tokens to JavaScript
* Expand the colour palette to include more shade/tints of specific hues of colour
* Shift to more semantically named colours
* Document and codify accessible colour combinations

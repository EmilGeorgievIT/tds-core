# Contributing to TDS

**_In early 2018, the TDS Platform team will be rolling out more robust architecture, tooling, and processes to better scale community 
component development and contribution._**

While we are not looking for direct contributions of _new_ components to the main TDS codebase quite yet, there are many 
other ways you can contribute, including submission of bug fixes, documentation improvements, and participation in discussions.

That being said, we welcome contributions of _enhancements_ to the currently available components in accordance with 
the component roadmaps. Check the [component documentation](ref://components/index.html) to see what is on the roadmap 
for each one. If you'd like to contribute to any of the available TDS components, [follow the steps below](#1-submit-issue).

Expect architectural changes and governance processes to be established soon that will drive a more mature contribution 
process. Thank you for your patience.  

Learn more by reading the [TELUS Design Platform road map](roadmap.md) or by [reaching out to us](support.md).


## How to contribute {#how-to}

### 1. Submit an issue {#1-submit-issue}

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues) to track all of our bugs and open discussions so that 
they are visible to the community. 

However, if you would like to make a small adjustment to documentation, you may jump straight to [opening a pull request](#3-pull-request). 
If you found a bug or would like to begin a conversation, follow these steps:

* Ensure the issue was not already reported by searching the [issues](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues)
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/issues/new)
* Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and - if applicable - a code 
sample or executable test case demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring

### 2. Develop a solution

To get started, fork [the repository](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds) and create your branch from master.

* The [designer guide](/contributing/designer-guide.md) will DO THINGASDKAFSDJFAKSDFJAKF.
* The [developer guide](/contributing/developer-guide.md) will help you set up your environment for TDS development.
* The [codebase overview](codebase-overview.md) will help you understand the structure of the codebase and the conventions being followed.

### 3. Make a pull request {#3-pull-request}

First, thanks for taking the time. :) 

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and the solution. Include the relevant issue number 
when you submit your pull request
* The TDS Platform team is monitoring for pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request 
changes to it, or close it with an explanation

# TDS Design Contribution

Guidelines & Standards

## Format:

* Design contributions should be contributed in the form of a Sketch file (*.sketch).

* Components and blocks that are being contributed to TDS should be in a separate sketch file, in stand-alone art boards (i.e. not in a mock of a project). This will reduce the risk of any confusion of what is being supplied for contribution.

* Files being contributed should be clearly named according to the TELUS Digital [file naming convention](https://docs.google.com/a/telus.com/document/d/1qqqwh3srXp8owsGEx_RnImyPxr6bP6KV1dfp7kV3o6g/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Viewports and Grid:

Each contribution should be supplied in the following viewports:

* XL (desktop): 1200+ px with container width 1168 px

* M (tablet): 768 px with container width 736 px

* XS (mobile): 320 px with container width 288 px

For each viewport supplied, the [TDS grid](http://tds.telus.com/3-Foundational-Elements/4-grid.html) should be applied to ensure consistent sizing and measurements across the system.

#### Page/Layer Naming:

Layers should be named clearly and not using the naming applied to it as standard with sketch (i.e. Layer 1, Layer 1 Copy). The naming structure uses forward slashes ( / ) instead of spacing.

Applying the above standards to the contributed sketch files will ensure a cohesive and consistent design language that can be used by all teams. Contributed blocks and components will be used by teams within TELUS and also external vendors.

## Typestyles: 

For the any of the components or blocks being contributed, the file should have the [TDS type stack](http://tds.telus.com/3-Foundational-Elements/6-typography.html) applied to any and ALL of the text blocks in the contribution (ie. Display, H1, H2, H3, etc). 

Note: We understand that there are some cases that require the type stack to change slightly (ie. colour of H1). In these cases, please make the appropriate change to the file, and note it during the contribution and we can add the new type stack style to the master TDS file. This helps us manage the type stack and will help when we make that update globally.

## Use of Symbols:

* Any of the components in TDS being used in the new component or block being contributed should be maintained as a symbol from the original master Sketch file. 

* **Any new components being contributed, should NOT be made into a symbol**. We will do this on our end and add it to the master Sketch file. This will ensure that the NEW symbol is named and put in the appropriate section. 

* TDS will manage any new symbols/components being contributed and allow us to add them globally to the design system for further reuse.

# Designer guide


**Work in progress...**


We use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com). You should get a license somehow...

Design contributions should be contributed in the form of a Sketch file.

Components that are being contributed to TDS should be in a separate sketch file, in stand-alone art boards 
(i.e. not in a mock of a project). This will reduce the risk of any confusion of what is being supplied for contribution.

Files being contributed should be clearly named according to the TELUS digital file naming convention. And that convention
is....

Contributed design files should be attached to the Github Issue, or if the design file is accompanying a code contribution,
it can be attached to the pull request.

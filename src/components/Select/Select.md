### Usage criteria

* Selects should be used sparingly where possible or need to reduce space on forms etc. (Work with design for specifics)
* Selects should have instructions such as "Please selectâ€¦" as a default option but not able to be selected.
* Selects are most appropriate when there are 4 or more choice. Less than 4, checkboxes or radios are more appropriate.

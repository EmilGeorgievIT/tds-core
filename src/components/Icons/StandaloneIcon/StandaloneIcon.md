### Making interactive icons

Standalone icons can also be interactive elements. This example shows the preferred way of creating an interactive icon:

```jsx
<button className="he_standalone-icon" type="submit">
    <StandaloneIcon symbol="spyglass" size={48} a11yText="Search this site." />
</button>
```

This will be added as a built in feature in the future, until then follow the above example.

# Upgrading Guide

## Upgrading from v0.4.x to v0.5.x

Icons will now be named to reflect their form, not any intended function. The following names have been deprecated:

* `alert` (use `exclamation-point-circle`)
* `close` (use `times`)
* `dash` (use `minus`)
* `help` (use `question-mark-circle`)

The classes and code point mappings from these deprecated names have been preserved for backwards compatibility in 0.5.x, but they should not be used in any new code.
Existing code should be updated to use the new aliases, to be prepared for the eventual removal of these names.

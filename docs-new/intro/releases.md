TDS releases often, and we put every effort into making the upgrade process as smooth as possible. TDS adheres to 
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) so that applications have a predictable way of managing the dependency.

*Please note: TDS has not yet reached v1.0, meaning it is still in a rapid development phase. While it is in 
the 0.y.z versions, minor version upgrades could contain breaking changes. We will try to minimize this as much as possible,
and will document these in the Release Notes and Changelog.*

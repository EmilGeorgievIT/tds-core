Developers:

* The [README](https://github.com/telusdigital/tds/blob/master/README.md) has installation and usage instructions.


## How do I use this site?

This is a live showcase, meaning this site is powered by actual TDS components. The interactive examples give you an idea
of both the aesthetic and the behaviour of the components, while the code snippets and API documentation give developers
the information needed to use the components in an application. Any edits you make to the code snippets will be immediately
reflected in the corresponding example.


## What's included in TDS?

1. Design assets are found in the master Sketch file, which can be downloaded in the Github Release page. (Link coming soon)
2. The core of TDS is a library of React components.
3. The master CSS stylesheet applies a minimal amount of global styles, such as a reset, base font settings, and box sizing.
4. The master CSS stylesheet provides class names for common HTML elements, such as forms, links, typography, and icons. (These will be deprecated soon.)
5. Common Sass variables and mixins are provided.
